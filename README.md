1. I used copilot to do the entire task, creating a bar chart that displays total amount spent in each category. 

2. I made sure I was very specific with the prompt I gave copilot. "add simple colors and a legend that states which category. also make sure it updates lives and it fits safely on the screen. you should also make the scale of the bar chart adjust variable to whatever the biggest number is."

3. A bug I encountered was I could not scroll through the app after this change, and I was able to use it to fix the problem for me.
